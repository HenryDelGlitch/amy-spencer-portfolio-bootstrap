## Background

This version of the website was created in 2022.  This was my first time incorporating 11ty as a CRM and deploying on netifly.  So I am sure there are some less than perfect parts to my code.


## Eleventy

Download the `eleventy` branch if you want a more modern setup using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) to compile different formats into HTML and enable templating. See installation steps below, although I still need to write something up on how to host with Eleventy.
