# This is my portfolio, which lives here [spencerproject.com](https://spencerproject.com/)

## Background

This version of the website was created in 2022. This was my first time using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) as a Static Site Generator. So I am sure there are some less than perfect parts to my code.


## Eleventy

Download the `eleventy` branch if you want a more modern setup using  to compile different formats into HTML and enable templating. See installation steps below, although I still need to write something up on how to host with Eleventy.
