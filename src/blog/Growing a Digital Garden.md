Many people start a blog and then let it wither away. I have done this a few times. The structure and the perfection always prevent me from maintaining a good blog.  This time I am goign to try a digital garden.

Digital Garden Goals
--------------

### 1\. Contribute 

I think about a lot of things!  I am afraid to share them for various reasons.  However I think it is so important to contribute to a community, to the common good.  That is supposing that what I have to say is good or has a community, LOL
!!


### 2\. Become a better writer

If you don't use it, you lose it, 

### 3\. Communicate with Future Teammates or Employers

Crazy, right? Using this blog I can literally talk with people I don't know yet... from the _future_.

> **Woah.**

In point #1 my audience is unknown, random folks hoping to solve a specific problem or learn something new. In #2 the audience is me. And in #3, my audience is people I may one day have the pleasure of working with.
