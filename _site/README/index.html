<h1>This is my portfolio, which lives here <a href="https://spencerproject.com/">spencerproject.com</a></h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This version of the website was created in 2022.  This was my first time incorporating 11ty as a CRM and deploying on netifly.  So I am sure there are some less than perfect parts to my code.</p>
<h2>Eleventy</h2>
<p>Download the <code>eleventy</code> branch if you want a more modern setup using <a href="https://11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> to compile different formats into HTML and enable templating. See installation steps below, although I still need to write something up on how to host with Eleventy.</p>
